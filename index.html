<b>Tell me about yourself.</b>

My name is Kerry, and my current position is Desktop Support. 
I started out in the digital world fixing xerox copiers and then moved in to supporting computers both hardware and software and printers. 
My current role involves providing support for developers and it has been very interesting going through the Thinkful Web Development course 
and gaining an understanding of what and why they ask for what they ask for.

<b>How many years of experience do you have in this role?</b>

I have been in technology in one form or another since 1998 building on each previous experience and moving on to better fill out my area of expertise. 
This will be a step in to the next area of technology utilizing the training I am receiving through Thinkful.

<b>Tell me about a recent project that you're proud of.</b>

What makes me proud is when someone says that it can not be done and then through research and communication, we figure out a way that it can be done. 
One example of this was when Covid-19 hit the world and almost everyone went home to work and we managed to support them through their issues without 
having to see them personally by showing up at their desk.

<b>What are your weaknesses?</b>

My main weakness is that my desk will look a bit messy to others but I know where things are and they are where I can get to them quick and/or the 
placement reminds me that it needs to be accomplished.

<b>Tell me about a time that you identified a problem at work. How did you solve it?</b>

We need to be able to run dos commands from a users desk and could not do that after Covid, 
I resolved this by using psexec to connect to their computer remotely and run the command.

<b>What are your salary requirements?</b>

That is a good question. According to google the average in the Pittsburgh area is between $74000.00 and $79000.00 does that sound about right to you?

    <pre style="background-color: beige"><b>Lesson Learned</b>
Even though it was my wife doing the interview, I still got nervous.. It was very helpful that I had prepared my responses and practiced them ahead of time. 
Which enabled me to answer the questions completely without drawing a blank during the nervousness. Most likely questions will be asked that you donâ€™t expect 
but at least this way you can answer the bulk of them with style.</pre>
